    <h1 align="center">Sapon Rodriguez</h1>.
<p>I am a 17-year-old Hispanic student with a passion for computer science. I have taken AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A, and I also attended the UT Computer Science for Women program. Additionally, I have participated in the Girls Who Code 2-week Summer Immersion Program and the One-Month Self-Paced Program.
<br>
    Initially, I thought I wanted to be an architect, but after being accepted into a summer program at Rice University, I discovered that computer science is my true passion. I am Java certified and Fusion 360 certified. I also participated in NASA's 6-Month Program.
<br>
    During my freshman year, I enrolled in an online summer coding camp called Creative Coding with JavaScript from June 7-11, 2021. I also took a summer coding camp called Java Basics during the same period.
